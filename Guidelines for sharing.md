Guidelines for Sharing: After listening to the days episode please share your reflections, thoughts and comments(it's optional to share). When you share please mention the Day example Day 314.
Avoid forwards or prayer requests or Hi's and Hello's - all content should be related to CIAY. 
The sharing that members post is their personal reflections and may or may not be accurate - it is to build each one up and to encourage the group.
 Feel free to post even if it's a simple post like "I felt comforted when I heard the word today" or "I am so confused about today's reading" any honest comment or reflections are welcome.  
 Finally let not one day pass without us praying for all the members of this WhatsApp group.
Thanks for reading.
