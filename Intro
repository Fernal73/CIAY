1. The countdown is ON - its less than 24 hours to CIAY 2023. Yeah!! So excited. :)

2. In order to prepare for this journey - please watch the below videos and print out the reading plan if you like to, it helps to track progress.

3. Fr Mike Schmitz is not part of the group and will not be joining as well, we only share the content from his programs.  
  I am Michael Eltham, the moderator of the group - I'm not Fr Mike - even though we have the same name. 
  Please contact me directly for any suggestions or questions.

### Sharing: 

After listening to the days episode please share your reflections, thoughts and comments(it's optional to share). When you share please mention the Day example Day 314.
Avoid forwards or prayer requests or Hi's and Hello's - all content should be related to CIAY. 

The sharing that members post is their personal reflections and may or may not be accurate - it is to build each one up and to encourage the group.
Feel free to post even if it's a simple post like "I felt comforted when I heard the word today" or "I am so confused about today's reading" any honest comment or reflections are welcome.  

Finally let not one day pass without us praying for all the members of this WhatsApp group.

Cannot wait!!! 

Thanks for reading.
